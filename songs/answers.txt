I would follow Spotify's way to calculate the top 100 songs, by taking average of danceability,valence
and energy to calculate for audio aura.

This aura may not be representative of listeners as music and songs are divided into different genres
and sub-genres and listeners have their own preferences. Also the popularity of the artists present in
production of a song also changes the audio aura.
